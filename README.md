_#PROPOSAL_

_##Defining the project scope_

	This system will sell building materials. It will 
	allow customers to do thier shopping online. The
	customers will be able to see, compare, choose, 
	and order and buy products online using their
	their bank cards.		
	
	Firstly, they register with the store using a form
	that will be placed online and store tha information
	on the Database.
	
	In terms of ordering online, they'll fill their bank
	details, but in this case, their bank details will not
	not be saved somewhere for safety sake. After the
	transaction the session will be terminated and not
	bank details for any customer will be saved.
	
	Customers will be able to edit and update their
	information if needed. They'll also be able to view 
	history or their orders and place their complains
	or any feedback.
	
	The administrator will be able to view everything on
	the database, and will have the ability to delete 
	customers, view all orders to generate reports, add 
	or delete products and view them. Only one administrator
	will have access to all that. Other administrators
	will have limited permissions.
	
	The system will be hosted on the following github
	account: "umswaonetjhejo."
	
	This project will completed in 40 days. So, the 
	system will be delivered on the 8th May 2014.
